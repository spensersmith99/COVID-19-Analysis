# COVID-19-Analysis
Data Source: Our World in Data.

My goal for this project was to delve deeper into the statistics surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic to gain a better understanding of its impact on the world. 
## SQL (BigQuery)
 Most of my work was centered around querying the dataset to find key information about the coronavirus such as the death and infection rates, global vaccinations, and the total amount of cases worldwide.
