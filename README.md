# COVID-19-Analysis
Data Source: Our World in Data.

My goal for this project was to delve deeper into the statistics surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic to better understand its impact on the world.

## SQL (BigQuery)
Most of my work was centered around querying the dataset to find key information about the coronavirus such as the death and infection rates, global vaccinations, and the total amount of cases worldwide.

## Tableau
Next, I created a dashboard in Tableau to help visualize some of my most important findings.

## Conclusion
COVID-19 has run rampant across the globe reaching over 150 million cases worldwide. While COVID-19 is clearly a highly infectious disease, it only has a mortality rate of about 2%. Although countries such as China and Nigeria have a large population, they had much fewer cases than other large countries like the United States or India. Due to their high number of cases throughout 2021, it is no surprise that both India and the United States lead the way in total number of vaccinations (for countries actively supplying data on vaccination status). Distinct, daily cases have skyrocketed in early 2022, which could be foreshadowing another tumultuous year.
